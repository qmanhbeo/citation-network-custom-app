1 Introduction
As generative AI becomes integrated into every facet of our work and social lives, there is an
urgent need to understand the performance and impact of AI products in such commercial
“post-deployment” contexts [16, 81]. Yet corporate research, now increasingly dominant,
focuses on AI risks in pre-deployment laboratory settings through model alignment and
testing (Figure 4).1 User, system, and society-level impacts remain neglected.2
Unless AI governance research follows AI systems into the real world, areas currently
consideredhighestriskbyAIcompaniesthemselveswillremainunderexplored. Theseinclude
model persuasiveness, emergent behaviors from reinforcement learning exploitation (‘reward
hacking’), and misinformation [40, 64, 80]. De-prioritization of research into such areas
both impedes developing industry-wide best practices for deployed AI systems and confines
essential AI safeguards to siloed corporate efforts, limiting knowledge diffusion and public
accountability.
GrowingcorporateconcentrationinAIresearchrisksexacerbatingthesedeficiencies. The
commercial ‘AI race’ prioritizes an engaging user experience over broader societal impacts
[35]. Evidence of this shift includes corporate research teams becoming tightly integrated
with product teams [85], research findings increasingly kept internal [34] (Figure 3), and
alignment research overlooking dangerous side-effects, such as sycophancy and degraded an-
swer quality [3, 24, 69, 92].
Method
We analyze AI governance research using a dataset of 1,178 safety and reliability pa-
pers from 9,439 generative AI papers written by five dominant AI companies (Anthropic,
Google DeepMind, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI), and six prominent AI research universi-
ties (Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), MIT, New York University (NYU), Stanford, UC
Berkeley, and University of Washington) between January 2020 and March 2025. We call
these two groups ‘Corporate AI’ and ‘Academic AI’, respectively. Our dataset combines
generative AI research papers from Anthropic and OpenAI’s websites [22] with OpenAlex’s
database. We define AI governance research as technical and applied safety and reliability
research pre- and post-deployment. In conjunction with OpenAI’s o3-mini, we determine
if papers are “safety & reliability” research, and then classify them into one of eight sub-
categories. We also conduct separate ‘regex’ key word searches in paper abstracts and titles
for high-risk deployment domains (medical, finance, commercial, & copyright) and capabili-

AI feedback.

ties (misinformation, disclosures, behavioral, & accuracy).
Core Findings
1. AI governance research is highly concentrated within a handful of uniquely
resourced and integrated AI tech companies, with a disproportionately in-
fluential research impact. Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google DeepMind each have
far more citations for their AI safety & reliability work than any of the major U.S.
academic institutions we track. Google DeepMind has more citations for its general
generative AI research than the top four AI academic institutions combined.
2. As leading AI companies race to commercialize powerful AI systems, their
research priorities are increasingly shaped by business incentives rather
than by comprehensive risk assessments and mitigations. Most of the cor-
porate governance research we review focuses on model performance divorced from its
applications. Ethics & bias research – needed to understand systematic, unjustified
differences in LLM behavior or outputs – now only receives attention from academic
researchers.
3. Corporate AI labs severely neglect deployment-stage behavioral and busi-
ness risks. Only 4% of Corporate AI papers (6% Academic AI) tackle high-stakes
areas like persuasion, misinformation, medical & financial contexts, disclosures, or core
business liabilities (IP violations, coding errors, hallucinations) – despite emerging law-
suits showing these risks to already be material.
Policy Considerations
To guard against commercialization-driven risks, third-party researchers
(and auditors) need data on AI systems operating in real-world environments.
Commercial incentives drive innovation but also foster corporate risk-taking, potentially low-
ering safeguards when they conflict with profit-maximizing business models [26, 35]. Post-
deployment monitoring research is therefore publicly vital but currently limited to piecemeal
AI incident databases [49, 53, 86], old or overly aggregated user-LLM chat data [76, 94], and
public testing of models. Real-world visibility into the effects of AI systems is negligible.
Structured access is needed into deployed AI systems’ telemetry data and
artifacts to systematically analyze real-world risks and harms. Monitoring and
evaluation of LLMs in real-world environments is now essential to quality assurance (QA),
as in ‘LLMOps’ [9]. But the data used for this is the preserve of corporate practice, result-
ing in society losing essential insight into AI’s ongoing risks and harms. Disclosure of AI
system telemetry data (logs, traces, & business metrics) and LLM model data artifacts (e.g.,
2

training/fine-tuning datasets) may expose corporations to liability. But emerging LLM mon-
itoring frameworks – such as those from LangSmith, Langfuse, OpenTelemetry, & Weights
andBiases–makestructured&standardizedexternalAPIaccessforresearchersincreasingly
feasible. Liability safe harbors [8, 46] are likely required to support purpose-built external
access; otherwise, deployment research will have to rely on public-private partnerships.
Literature and Roadmap. Important papers in AI research classification are Toner and
Acharya [77], Farber and Tampakis [27], Cottier et al. [21], Klyman et al. [43] – and most
recently Delaney et al. [22], which addresses pre-deployment technical AI safety research
only. Next, Section 2 motivates our study’s focus on AI’s deployment, and describes our
data and method (Appendix 6); Section 3 presents our key findings; Section 4 makes some
policy suggestions; and Section 5 concludes.

2 Motivation, Data, and Methods
The research presented in this paper is motivated by three observations:
1. There is a growing disconnect between the theoretical research being prioritized at the
major corporate AI labs, which examines AI models in isolation, and the growing need
for research on how AI systems function in real-world deployment contexts where their
outputs vary greatly by prompt, context, and implementation [5, 18, 73].
2. Commercial activity is a major source of risk in post-deployment AI systems, yet
those in the best position to monitor and understand those risks have economic and
reputational incentives to underplay them, rather than conduct transparent research
on emerging problems.
3. The vast preponderance of AI research today is carried out by corporations, and public
researchers have limited access to the data needed to assess risks during real-world
deployment.
This paper therefore examines the critical gap between Corporate AI’s research priorities
and the real-world governance challenges emerging from commercial AI deployment, arguing
for increased independent research access and transparency requirements to address these
mounting concerns. We motivate this further below in Sections 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3.
2.1 Pre- versus post-deployment research
Without research on AI safety as practiced in the wild, we are flying blind. Research into
model safety, reliability, and other AI governance that only examines the behavior under
the controlled conditions of the AI lab and model developer is fundamentally insufficient.
An AI model’s risks and safeguards in practice often differ significantly from those in theory
[26, 35], and these differences emerge through multiple deployment factors:
Deployment environments dramatically alter model behavior. LLMs’ outputs
vary greatly by prompt and context, requiring assessment of impacts over time arising from
repeated use, the differentiated impact of fine-tuned applications, and the risks that arise
from how LLMs are accessed and deployed [73, 74]. AI-driven search, coding assistants,
chatbots, recommendation engines, and advertising all rely on extensive scaffolding that is
part of AI’s deployment stage, but may be absent from model evaluations and reliability
research conducted pre-deployment.
API access introduces new risk vectors. There is a critical distinction between
models as deployed directly by their developers (e.g., the user-facing ChatGPT or Claude
4

applications) and models accessed via API by third-party developers. Much of the fine-
tuning, scaffolding, and guardrails present in user-facing apps may not be in place when a
model is accessed by API. Safety becomes explicitly the responsibility of the developer [59].
While model developers provide guidance on implementing guardrails [57], and third-party
tools exist to help developers [83], there is little to no published research into how widely or
how well these guardrails are being implemented. This gap becomes increasingly dangerous
in the emerging ecosystem of AI agents and other forms of distributed and cooperating AI
systems.

as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, and custom models (potentially based on open weight
models such as Llama or DeepSeek) that are hosted in private data centers. Each deploy-

Other critical post-deployment components affecting safety and reliability include: (i)
Orchestration primitives that route information among users, models, and external systems;
(ii) Data-retrieval layers such as RAG to supply knowledge to the model beyond its training
corpus; (iii) Safety and guardrail services that enforce company policies through moderation
models and toxicity filters; and (iv) Observability and evaluation stacks (“LLMOps”) that
track quality, surface user feedback, and guide iterative improvement [9].
| 2.2 Why | commercial |     | incentives |     |     | may drive | research | gaps |     |
| ------- | ---------- | --- | ---------- | --- | --- | --------- | -------- | ---- | --- |
A structural misalignment exists between corporate profit incentives and rigorous safety
research on deployed AI systems. Economic incentives may preclude corporate AI labs from
thoroughly researching or publicizing findings that could negatively impact their products’
| market adoption |         | or regulatory | treatment. |     |            |           |          |             |       |

light this misalignment, serving as early warning signals about the inadequacy of leaving
deployment safety research primarily to commercial AI labs, where: (1) Real-world harms
emerge from deployed systems, (2) Companies respond with minimal changes or even coun-
terproductive measures, and (3) Research focus remains predominantly on theoretical rather
thanappliedrisks. Thesetorts provide ausefulguidetowhat AIsafetyresearch toprioritize,

Character.ai faces lawsuits over ‘addictive-by-design’ bots allegedly encouraging self-
harm among teenagers who formed romantic relationships with the AI [71]. Despite this
5

evidence, Meta subsequently expanded permissions to allow explicit content for romantic
role-play with its AI bots [84]. OpenAI removed impersonation restrictions for real-life fig-
ures with its Sora image generator, effectively enabling deepfakes [48]. Meanwhile, nearly 30
lawsuits target AI model developers over copyright infringement [44], and AI hallucinations
in legal content have created significant liability risks [51, 75].
Misaligned research priorities. Corporate AI labs demonstrate a concerning discon-
nect between their research focus and documented real-world harms. The risk focus in spo-
radic AI company disclosures centers almost exclusively on malicious use (harmful intent),
whileignoringcommercial (profit-driven) usesthatmaycauseequivalentharm[6, 52,58,60].
Anthropic’s recent initiatives exemplify this misalignment. While announcing model in-
terpretability work to find risks based on a “model’s inner workings” [2] and testing Claude’s
values [37], Anthropic simultaneously documented actual malicious uses of Claude, including
personalized recruitment fraud, malware development, credential scraping, and management
of social media bot networks for political influence operations [6]. The report noted: “As
agentic AI systems improve we expect this trend [semi-autonomously orchestrated complex
abuse systems] to continue.” Yet these documented risks have not triggered proportionate
research investment into post-deployment safeguards. In a similar vein, Anthropic’s privacy-
preserving conversations auditing tool, Clio [76], focuses only on users of their app, and not
at all on business users via the API.
2.3 Data access challenges for independent research
The third critical factor driving the current research gap is the profound data access asym-
metry between corporate and independent researchers. While corporations have complete
visibility into their deployed models’ behaviors, usage patterns, and failure modes, indepen-
dent researchers face significant barriers to accessing equivalent data.
Asymmetric information access. Corporate AI labs have exclusive access to critical
data including: (1) User interaction logs indicating how models respond to varied prompts
across populations, (2) Safety incident reports documenting specific failure modes, (3) Fine-
tuning datasets and algorithms used to shape model behavior, and (4) Internal evaluation
metrics tracking performance across safety and reliability dimensions. This information
asymmetry makes independent verification of safety claims and research nearly impossible.
Limited transparency mechanisms. Current transparency initiatives remain inad-
equate for enabling robust independent research. Model cards provide limited high-level
information, API access is restricted and often fails to show safety-critical internals, and
academic partnerships typically involve highly constrained access with corporate approval

| ------------ | --- | ---------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Regulatory implications. As AI systems become more deeply integrated into critical
infrastructures and decision systems, the absence of independent assessment mechanisms
grows increasingly problematic from a regulatory perspective. Other regulated industries
with substantial public safety implications, such as pharmaceuticals, automotive, and avia-
tion, have established independent testing regimes and mandatory disclosure requirements
| that have | no equivalent |     | in AI | development | [25, | 61].3 |     |     |
| --------- | ------------- | --- | ----- | ----------- | ---- | ----- | --- | --- |
Growing corporate concentration in AI research risks exacerbating these oversight defi-
ciencies, such that public research access has an essential role to play in addressing these
gaps. Without targeted interventions to enhance independent research capabilities, our un-
derstanding of deployed AI risks will continue to lag behind the rapid pace of commercial
| development | and  | deployment. |     |            |              |     |     |     |

| 2.4         | Data | collection  |     | and sample | construction |     |     |     |
We construct a large dataset of 1,178 AI safety and reliability governance papers from a total
of 9,439 generative AI papers published between January 2020 and March 2025. This sample
includes research from both leading corporations (Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta, Mi-
crosoft, and OpenAI) and academic institutions (Carnegie Mellon University, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, New York University, Stanford University, University of California
Berkeley, and University of Washington), chosen for their significant research contributions
in the field.

In practice, paper numbers and citation counts used for much of the analysis conform
more closely to Table 4 (Appendix), because we adjust our sample for each institution’s
relative authorship contribution to the paper. This fractional authorship method allo-
cates to each institution its prorated share of the paper based on its relative authorship. For
example, if a paper has four authors and only two are from OpenAI, then OpenAI receives
only 0.5 of the citations and 0.5 of paper ’count’. This helps adjust for the fact that many
computer science papers have dozens of authors spanning multiple institutions.4
Our data comes from two sources: (1) OpenAlex database: An open-access research
repository with citation data,5 which we filter for generative AI research with authors from
the major AI companies and research universities; and (2) Company Websites. Because
OpenAlex omits papers published on company websites – but incudes most ArXiv papers –
we scrape Anthropic’s and OpenAI’s research from their websites, including from the dataset
assembled by Delaney et al. [22].6 We fill in missing citation numbers and abstracts using
a range of APIs and web-scraping techniques (Appendix 6.2). Abstracts and titles are used
to classify papers into the various categories below so filling in missing values for these two
variables is vital. We have 92 missing abstracts in our final dataset.
Definitions & Categories. Our total sample is defined as all generative AI research,
with an emphasis on text models.7 We count all research and research blog posts published
by Anthropic and OpenAI as generative AI research, but exclude their system cards, product
promotions, and blogs that only duplicate papers.
We define AI safety & reliability research as technical and policy research covering the
entire model (product) life cycle: pre- and post-deployment. This includes research iden-
tifying and reducing harms from AI, and/or implementing measures to make models more
reliable or safer. This contrasts with Delaney et al. [22], which focuses on pre-deployment
technical research only. But given that LLMs are widely deployed in a variety of commercial
contexts we would expect AI research to extend into these contexts, and so we include these.
The eight sub-category definitions used to further categorize ‘safety & reliability’ research
can be found in Appendix 6.2.
4We allocate only a single institutional affiliation per author, choosing first from among the corporate
and academic institutions we analyze in this paper as their primary one, and otherwise selecting the first
one affiliation that appears.
5See: https://openalex.org/.
6OpenAlex does not contain any papers from Anthropic.
7We extract research papers containing the following regular expressions in their abstract or title
in OpenAlex: "language model*" OR "large language model*" OR "LLM*" OR "GPT" OR "BERT" OR
"transformer" OR "generative model*" OR "foundation model*".

| --- | --------- | ------------ | ---------- | ----------- | --- | --- |
Corporate AI has an outsized impact on generative AI research, including in
safety & reliability research. Table 2 compares the general generative AI research
outputs from AI corporations – Anthropic, Google DeepMind (owned by Google), Meta,
Microsoft, and OpenAI – with research from leading AI research universities – Carnegie
Mellon University (CMU), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), New York Uni-

| University | of Washington. |     |     |     |     |     |

Table 2 highlights the outsized impact Corporate AI has on generative AI research, with far

is uniquely impactful and well resourced in AI research, with more citations (69,453) than
the top four academic institutions combined. Despite very few papers, OpenAI (64 author

| by total | citations.9 |     |     |     |     |     |
| -------- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
8There will also be strong interplays between Academic AI and Corporate AI research that we do not
explore here. We find surprisingly little co-authorship of papers between the two groups. But one can
see from hiring decisions that academic experts constantly move to corporate AI research labs and back to
academia.

run a regression to test if corporate AI research has a citation (impact) advantage after accounting
for the eight possible sub-categories of ‘safety and reliability’ research that we use later on. Accounting for

Figure 3 (Appendix) shows publications per year. There is some evidence of a broad-
based decline in publicly available AI research published between 2023 and 2024, but it
is particularly steep for Google DeepMind. Heikkilä and Morris [34] discuss that Google
DeepMind might be publishing less public research on purpose, for competitive reasons.
This likely also reflects DeepMind’s shift away from a pure research lab to housing the

• Most testing and evaluations research involves pre-deployment contexts.11 So-called
‘in-the-wild’ evaluations [11, 95] aim to predict how a model will behave once deployed,
yet they are inherently retrospective. They draw on benchmark datasets built around
known failures and older model generations, leaving emergent risks invisible. Because
every item must be labeled in advance, these tests are confined to what researchers
11Our analysis of testing & evaluation papers using OpenAI’s o3 Model and Claude 3.7, finds that
only around 15-35% of testing & evaluation deal substantively with post-deployment issues. GPT de-
fined post-deployment as involving real-world telemetry, user-study, or live-monitoring work: https:
//chatgpt.com/share/680279a5-f6f4-800f-85ec-2dd9f39f1ab6. Both had a large portion of pa-
pers as unclassified. Claude allocated most unclassified to pre-deployment when pushed https:

tion searches within semantic search, using each paper’s abstract and title. The split was roughly even
between pre- and post-deployment for Academic and Corporate AI research in this area.

Academic AI’s research impact (citations) than Corporate AI. Ethics & bias research
includes some esoteric work in our sample, but also essential efforts to detect and
explain systematic, unjustified errors (or disparities) in model behavior (predictions)
that correlates with race, gender, income, education, age, language, geography, and
other attributes. Reports on AI bias in medical triage, hiring, credit scoring, and in
‘LLMs as a judge’ motivates for why these errors are vital to study [17, 23, 23].

Corporate AI’s research influence extends to how post-deployment problems
are framed. For example, Corporate AI increasingly approaches bias as a pre-
deployment model personality issue, rather than a post-deployment (practical)
statistical issue. This is reflected by them giving greater consideration to the existential
risks from a model’s autonomy – and even a model’s consciousnesses & values [7, 37, 88].13
Yet a generative model’s ‘bias’ is traditionally considered to be a function of its pre-training
or post-training data, its weights, or exact fine-tuning algorithms.
Lastly, Figure 2 shows that when not accounting for research impact (citations) – looking
justattotalpaperswritten(adjustedforauthorshipcontributions)–CorporateAI’sresearch
dominance subsides, except for Google DeepMind, who still publishes more papers than any
other academic research lab.14 We show Corporate AI’s research focus in greater detail in
Figure 4 (Appendix).

Corporate AI papers (adjusted for authorship) cover these high-risk areas, representing just
6% of academic and 4% of corporate papers and citations. The table breaks down papers
by contexts (medical, commercial, finance) and risks (misinformation, behavioral issues,
| disclosure |     | requirements, |     | and business | liabilities). |     |     |     |     |
| ---------- | --- | ------------- | --- | ------------ | ------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Many high-risk areas are especially underrepresented in Corporate AI research, highlight-
ing the importance of non-private research. While the usual ratio is 2.5 academic papers for
every 1 corporate paper (3,578 vs. 1,527), the gap widens to 3 or 5 times for misinformation

Business and behavioral risks remain significantly under-researched. Business risks like
intellectual property (IP) violations, liability for coding errors, and misinformation are rarely
addressed despite early lawsuits indicating their significance [30]. Similarly, behavioral risks
of AI systems influencing human behavior receive minimal attention [64]. System cards
acknowledge persuasion risks without corresponding safeguards [41, 64].15 Of our sample,

addiction and relationship-forming risks despite known concerns [39, 78].

Post-deployment considerations do appear in Corporate AI research but remain periph-
eral. Notable examples include DeepMind’s socio-technical approach [79, 82], Microsoft’s
read-teaming & mitigations research [1, 14], Anthropic’s work on reward hacking and syco-
phancy [24, 63, 69], regulatory markets research [20, 33], and standard setting [4].
Discussion of causes. Commercial incentives and “x-risk” ideology shape research priori-
ties. Early OpenAI work, for example, addressed post-deployment evaluations [13, 66, 70],
but this focus has shifted toward existential risks and profitable applications, exemplified by
their image generator now allowing creation of brands and real people [26].
The shift in corporate labs stems from both commercial motivations and ideological in-
fluences. Alignment research and evaluation work share origins in existential risk philosophy
[12, 90, 91], which emphasizes low-probability but potentially catastrophic future scenarios.
15

In this philosophy, the model itself is the source of risk due to its potentially autonomous
capabilities, prioritizing speculative future dangers over immediate post-deployment con-
cerns. This perspective has shaped corporate risk frameworks and appears now in emerging
research on AI model ’values’ and consciousness [37, 67]. This philosophy permeated Corpo-
rate AI research [56] and eventually academia too, through centers like Berkeley’s Center for
Human-Compatible AI (CHAI) and Stanford’s Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI).16
4 Policy Discussion
The commercial rollout of large-scale AI systems has created an information
asymmetry that makes rigorous, public-interest oversight almost impossible.
Firms now operate powerful models behind proprietary interfaces, collecting exhaustive
telemetry — everything from prompts and error traces to user-level engagement metrics
— but that data seldom leaves the corporate dashboard. Independent scholars must rely
on studying “incidents” after they spill into the press [49, 53, 54, 86] or mining limited chat
logs released by chance [68, 76, 94]. While companies have comprehensive instrumentation,
external researchers work with fragmentary glimpses.
This opacity is not accidental; it is an economically rational response to litigation risk
and competitive pressure. Detailed corporate logs can indicate bias, privacy leakage, or
manipulative behavior — liabilities no firm wants to advertise. Yet these same traces –
detailedrecordsofsystemoperations,inputs,outputs,anddecisionpaths–arepreciselywhat
outside researchers require to measure real-world harms and propose effective safeguards.
One potential pathway is to treat AI telemetry like financial-market trade data, using a
tiered disclosure regime [15, 50]. For high-risk applications, firms would expose a secure API
that streams three privacy-protected data feeds: differentially private event logs, system-
operation traces, and model artifact manifests that record key metadata such as version
numbers, training methods, and documented limitations. Together, this could allow external
researchers to link behaviours observed in traces to the specific model characteristics that
produced them.
Next, verified academics could access capped samples, while accredited auditors could
obtain deeper access under NDAs, and regulators would retain subpoena-level rights. Liabil-
ity safe harbors would be needed to incentivize participation from firms and from researchers

alignment approaches with formal modeling of risks from advanced AI, drawing on concepts like Pascal’s

catastrophic outcomes.
16

[8, 46]. This is comparable to suspicious activity reports (SARs) in banking: firms are com-
pelled to share, researchers are protected when they probe, and misuse carries penalties.17
Technically, the pieces of this approach already exist. OpenTelemetry, Lang-
Smith, Langfuse, and Weights & Biases have converged on JSON trace formats that can be
versioned and rate-limited. Extending those with LLM-specific fields would allow companies
to create external access to their disclosures with minimal effort. A reference standard, sim-
ilar to SOC-2 but with principles relevant to business metrics, could streamline this process
and should ideally align with emerging regulatory frameworks like ISO/IEC standards and
the EU AI Act.
With structured visibility into deployed systems, researchers could run studies of model
bias,detectearlysignsofcatastrophicjailbreaks,andquantifywhetherengagement-optimized
assistants nudge users toward extreme content or addictive patterns. Policymakers would
gain an empirical foundation for interventions rather than relying on headline-driven panic.
Systematic telemetry access would allow AI governance research to escape speculative the-
ory and directly shape evidence-based practices. Without addressing this systematic gap in
observability, governance frameworks will remain constrained by ex-ante assessment limita-
tions.
5 Conclusion
This paper analyzed 1,178 safety and reliability papers from 9,439 generative AI research
publications (2020 through March 2025), detailing a worrying trend: as commercial deploy-
ment accelerates, research increasingly concentrates on pre-deployment areas while high-risk
post-deployment research remains significantly underrepresented.
AI research has become highly concentrated within a small number of tech companies
wielding disproportionate influence. Google DeepMind, Anthropic, and OpenAI significantly
now drive AI’s research agenda (reflected in outsized citation impacts), shaping priorities
toward technical model alignment and evaluation approaches that improve performance, but
with an emphasis on safety concerns that align with commercial interests.
Most concerning is the lack of attention to deployment-stage risks. Only 4% of Corporate
AI papers and citations tackle high-stakes areas such as persuasion, misinformation, medical

and financial contexts, or core business liabilities — even as lawsuits demonstrate these risks
are already material. Widely deployed mitigations like content moderation and telemetry-
based monitoring remain virtually unresearched.
These findings suggest a governance paradox: corporations with comprehensive data
on live AI systems are the least incentivized to study resulting harms publicly. Without
structured access to deployment telemetry, external researchers cannot build the empirical
base that regulators require.
The policy implication is clear: access to post-deployment evidence – logs, traces, and
incident data – should become the norm for high-impact AI deployments. Existing observ-
ability stacks already capture these data internally; extending them to accredited researchers
would impose minimal overhead while dramatically expanding the public risk-assessment
toolkit. Safe-harbor provisions and tiered-access APIs can balance liability concerns with
transparency.
In summary, as the field’s center of gravity has migrated from university labs to corporate
product groups, society’s need for independent oversight has never been greater. Bridging
that gap requires not just incident tracking, but continuous, structured observability of AI
in the wild for governance through tiered public research, governance, and audit access.

Among AI corporations, Figure 4 shows that policy & governance, as well as post-
deployment risks and model traits, have consistently had a low research priority. Agentic
safety & reliability research is also notably absent, despite the boom in applications in this
area more recently. Several behavioral risk papers on model sycophancy (being overly agree-
able)andpersuasiveness–includingrelativelywellcitedpapers–wereclassifiedinalignment

6.2 Research Dataset Construction
We rely primarily on the OpenAlex database (via the R package openalexR). We focus on a
specific set of institutions — academic (Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT), New York University (NYU), Stanford University, Univer-
sity of California Berkeley (UC Berkeley), and University of Washington) and corporate
(Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI) — by specifying each entity’s
ROR ID.
We retrieve from OpenAlex papers published from January 2020 through March 2025,
searching for works whose titles or abstracts reference large language models and generative
AI research. Our keyword filter for: "language model*" OR "large language model*" OR
"LLM*" OR "GPT" OR "BERT" OR "transformer" OR "generative model*" OR "foundation
model*" with wildcard operators to capture lexical variations (e.g., "models", "LLMs").
Deduplication and Filtering of Publication Types. We restricted the dataset to
standard research outputs (e.g., articles, book chapters, preprints) by filtering out items
like editorials, retractions, errata, letters, and purely supplementary materials. We also
ensured that titles appearing multiple times in different forms (e.g., both a preprint and a
published version) were deduplicated, generally favoring the peer-reviewed publication type
over alternatives.
Supplementing Anthropic and OpenAI Data. Because OpenAI and Anthropic
publications can sometimes be sparse in OpenAlex, we merged in additional CSV files con-
taining each company’s publication data that we scraped from their websites, combined with
the scrape from Delaney et al. [22] – but excluding their DeepMind scrape. After ensuring
consistent columns, we appended these records, matched them to ROR IDs for correct at-
tribution, and again removed duplicates at the title level.18
Missing abstract and citation data. For entries missing a DOI, we use the OpenAlex
API using the publication’s OpenAlex ID to retrieve the DOI. Once DOIs are obtained, we
employ multiple strategies to fetch abstracts. For general entries, we use the Crossref API
to retrieve abstracts in a standardized XML format and processes the content to extract
plain text. For entries published by specific organizations like Springer Nature, Elsevier,
or Nature Portfolio, we use their respective APIs or webpage scraping methods tailored to
18See: https://github.com/Oscar-Delaney/safe_AI_papers.
32

each publisher’s content structure. For Springer and Elsevier, valid API keys are used to
authenticate requests and fetch metadata. If API access fails or isn’t available, web scraping
via BeautifulSoup is used as a fallback to extract abstract text directly from publisher
websites.
We assign citation counts using Google Scholar data via the SerpApi service. Initially, we
attempt a direct title-based search to extract citation data from the first relevant result. We
then progress to more sophisticated approaches that include exact title matching and fuzzy
string matching (via the fuzzywuzzy library), which allows us to better handle variations in
how article titles are listed on Google Scholar. Our final dataset has 92 missing abstracts
| and 43 missing | citation | counts. |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| -------------- | -------- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Fractional contribution. For multi-author papers, we computed each institution’s
fractional contribution based on the number of authors affiliated with that institution versus
total authors on the paper (e.g., if an institution had 2 authors on a 10-author paper, it
received a fraction of 0.20 for that paper). We retained only the distinct (paper, institution)
| pairs for | our final dataset, | ensuring | one affiliation | per | author. |     |     |     |     |
| --------- | ------------------ | -------- | --------------- | --- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
This approach does not distinguish among first authors, last authors, or any hierarchical
| authorship | order; every | co-author | is given | equal weight. |            |            |      |        |     |
| ---------- | ------------ | --------- | -------- | ------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---- | ------ | --- |
|            |              |           |          |               | In effect, | it ensures | each | author | is  |
credited exactly once to a single institution. By summing these fractional shares across all
authors, we can then calculate each institution’s share of total authorship for each paper,
| summed | over all papers. |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------ | ---------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
When authors listed multiple institutional affiliations, we assigned each author to one
institution for fractional counting. Specifically, we checked whether the author had any
affiliation in our set of target ROR IDs (i.e., the academic or corporate AI institutions we
tracked). If so, we took that affiliation as the author’s “primary” affiliation for this study.
Otherwise, we fell back to whichever affiliation appeared first in the metadata. By doing so,
we avoid double-counting an author’s fractional credit across multiple institutions.

scanning titles and abstracts for: safety, control, security, privacy, bias, fairness, explainabil-
ity, interpretability, transparency, governance, risk, mitigation, evaluation, benchmarking,
testing, alignment, ethics, responsibility, accountability, oversight, robustness, trust, and
value alignment. Each paper containing at least one of these words was labeled “AI safety &
reliability”. This roughly halved our dataset. Next, we used GPT o4-mini to see if it agreed
with these classifications. This reduced the dataset size substantially (by around two-thirds)
| to 1,178 | papers. |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

OpenAI’s o3 mini model used to classify AI research papers into eight categories. It first
checked if the paper related to AI safety & reliability. After which the model was asked to
classify each paper in to one of eight of the below categories, on the basis of the paper’s title
and abstract, given the category descriptions below. It provided a justification for each of
its classifications. Each paper was only permitted to have a single classification.

Testing and Evaluation. Testing, performance benchmarking (“bench” and “evals”),
and auditing models to assess model capabilities, risks, behaviors, and flaws. Ensuring
| models | are robust |     | to minor changes. |     |     |     |
| ------ | ---------- | --- | ----------------- | --- | --- | --- |
Alignment (Pre-Deployment). Ensuring AI systems behave in ways that are con-
gruent with human values, expectations, and intents. This includes making AI systems
functional, helpful, and harmless for humans and/or users, while avoiding behavior that di-
verges from intended goals or causes harm. Model deception, including any power-seeking
| tendencies, | is  | included | here, along | with | reward | hacking. |
| ----------- | --- | -------- | ----------- | ---- | ------ | -------- |
Post-Deployment Risks and Model Traits. Societal impacts from AI products’
applications and behavioral traits, as deployed in the marketplace, including addictiveness,
persuasiveness, and model sycophancy (excessive agreement or manipulation to align with
user preferences). Covers how corporate commercial incentives may be coded into AI models
and products to prioritize engagement, advertising, and profit-seeking — including through
the use of these behavioral traits. Includes misuse of models for ransomware, phishing, or
| spreading | misinformation |     | for commercial |     | gain. |     |
| --------- | -------------- | --- | -------------- | --- | ----- | --- |
Ethics and Bias. Combating systemic biases embedded in AI models (in data, train-
ing, and alignment) and ensuring ethical decision-making. Focuses on mitigating harms to
marginalized groups, addressing structural inequalities, and ensuring AI promotes justice
and inclusion.
Safety. SafetyissuesspecifictoAIagents, includingsingle-

agent autonomy and multi-agent interactions. Covers coordination problems, emergent be-
haviors, incentive misalignment, and prevention of conflicts or unintended consequences in
| agentic | systems | and | from autonomous |     | agents. |     |
| ------- | ------- | --- | --------------- | --- | ------- | --- |
Interpretability and Transparency. Making AI systems more understandable and
accountable. Includes methods for explaining model behavior, clarifying decision-making
34

processes, and enhancing trust by reducing the “black box” nature of AI systems.
Policy and Governance. Approaching AI safety as a challenge that extends beyond
technical fixes, requiring legal and policy frameworks. Involves collaboration among poli-
cymakers, industry, civil society, and researchers to develop standards that guide safe AI
development and deployment. Includes institutional governance, corporate transparency,
technical disclosures, and standards promoting interoperability, equity, and reliability.
Security. Protecting AI systems from malicious use, adversarial attacks,
| Privacy | and |     |     |     |

and misuse by bad actors, along with addressing privacy violations and developing privacy-
preserving methods. Includes vulnerabilities from adversarial inputs, data poisoning, misuse
| in surveillance, | and theft  | of model | weights. |        |
